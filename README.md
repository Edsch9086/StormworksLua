## This is a collection of all of my Stormworks microcontroller LUA scripts.
___

### Intent:

The intent of these scripts and microcontrollers is to provide a set of efficient, easy to set up and customize, performance-conscious, and intuitive controllers for some common and not-so-common drivetrain and mechanisms for vehicles in Stormworks

### Projects:

Current projects that are being worked on/are planned to be worked on are:

- Swerve Drive Controller
    - nearly done, need to iron out waypoint logic

- Tank Drive Controller
    - nowhere near done

- Typical wheeled vehicle controller
    - not started yet

- Waterjet Controller
    - not started yet

- 6-Axis Arm Controller
    - not started yet
    - probably biting off more than i can chew here but ah well

- This is going to go very, very slowly.
    - If you are anticipating things here, don't.
