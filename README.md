## This is a collection of all of my Stormworks microcontroller LUA scripts.
___

### Intent:

The intent of these scripts and microcontrollers is to provide a set of efficient, easy to set up and customize, performance-conscious, and intuitive controllers for some common and not-so-common drivetrain and mechanisms for vehicles in Stormworks

### Projects:

Current projects that are being worked on/are planned to be worked on are:

- Swerve Drive Controller
    - nearly done, need to iron out waypoint logic

- Tank Drive Controller
    - nowhere near done

- Typical wheeled vehicle controller
    - not started yet

- Waterjet Controller
    - not started yet

- 6-Axis Arm Controller
    - not started yet
    - probably biting off more than i can chew here but ah well

### Personal Notes:

- This is going to go very, very slowly.
    - If you are anticipating things here, don't. 
    - I only work on this in my spare time.
    - overambitious projects are my specialty :3

- If you have questions/comments/concerns, feel free to contact me.
    - Best way: Discord; Potat9086
    - Worst way: Email; potat9086@gmail.com
    - Truly worst way: Carrier pigeon or message in a bottle

- All code here is technically licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 License, however i will not uphold that.
    - All I ask is that if you decide to use some of this in one of your projects, please credit me.
